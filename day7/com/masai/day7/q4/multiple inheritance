Why is multiple inheritance not supported in java at class level ?


public class MultipleInheritance {
	Let suppose we have 3 classes
		Class A
		Class B
		And Class C
		Now if
		Class A extends Class B and Class C both
		And if in both of the Classes have same methods then the Compiler will confuse that
		Whom to  execute,i t will show ambiguity.
		So,this is the main reason why JAVA not Support Multiple Inheritance.
