there are many differences between abstract class and interface


1. Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods,but Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.
 
 2.Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance,Interface supports multiple inheritance.
 
 3.Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables,but Interface has only static and final variables.
 
 4. Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface,but 
 Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
 
 5.The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class,but The interface keyword is used to declare interface.
 
 6.An abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces,but An interface can extend another Java interface only.
